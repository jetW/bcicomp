=======
Datasets are in the dataset folder. We are currently looking at one particular dataset, but we will use each algorithm on each as soon as we finish creating the algorithm and making sure they work correctly.

Dependencies
=======
You'll need eeglab, and it must be placed in the appropriate folder ('../Libraries/eeglab_folder'), that is, if you don't want to change the library location.
